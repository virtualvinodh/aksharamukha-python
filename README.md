# Aksharamukha Python Package

Aksharamukha aims to provide transliteration a.k.a script conversion between various scripts within the Indic cultural sphere.  These include historic scripts, contemporary Brahmi-derived/inspired scripts, scripts invented for minority Indian languages, scripts that have co-existed with Indic scripts (like Avestan) or linguistically related scripts like Old Persian. It also specifically provides lossless transliteration between the main Indian scripts (along with Sinhala).

Apart from the simple mapping of characters, Askharamukha also attempts to implement various script/language-specific orthographic conventions (where known) such as vowel lengths, gemination and nasalization. It also provides several customization options to fine-tune and get the desired orthography.

Aksharamukha as of now supports 85 scripts and 8 romanization methods.
